I got a shoutout in the [Cornell Chronicle](http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/05/6-phd-students-learn-commercialize-their-research) today regarding the commercialization fellowship I will be starting in June. 

This is actually the first I've seen of the complete list of the other five inaugural fellows. Sup guys!

I will post here periodically about my progress in the fellowship which runs from June 20th through December.
